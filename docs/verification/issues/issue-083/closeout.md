## Tests Passed
Shared package tests, web tests, web build, API tests, Docker config/startup/migration/health, no-PHI scanner, and docs contract gate are recorded for this batch.

## Evidence Paths
docs/verification/issues/issue-083/simulation-output-basic.json, docs/verification/issues/issue-083/simulation-output-surge.json

## Known Limitations
No walking time, optimizer, API, persistence, UI, export, or clinical claim was added by this issue.

## Non-PHI Confirmation
Non-PHI rules still pass: synthetic operational IDs only, no real identity data, no EHR integration, no clinical safety certification language, and no patient record workflow.

## Next Recommended Issue
Issue 084 - Nurse Queue and Interrupt Handling
